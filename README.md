# python-chatgpt-os
Using the ChatGPT chat bot, I had the ai write an "operating system" in python. This is what it came up with.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

I asked the chatbot the question, "What features and programs should a modern operating system include?"


The bot responded with the following:

A modern operating system should include a number of features and programs that are
essential for the smooth and efficient operation of a computer. Some of the key features
that a modern operating system should include are:
A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the computer using
visual elements such as icons, menus, and windows.
A multitasking environment that allows multiple programs to run simultaneously and
share system resources such as memory and processor time.
Support for a wide range of hardware devices, including printers, scanners, and external
storage devices.
A file management system that allows users to organize and access their files and folders.
A security system that protects the computer and its data from unauthorized access and
Viruses.
An app store or other mechanism for downloading and installing new applications.
System utilities for maintaining and optimizing the performance of the computer.
In addition to these core features, a modern operating system should also include a range of
built-in programs and tools for common tasks such as web browsing, email, and word
processing. These programs should be easy to use and provide a consistent user experience
across the operating system.


I then asked for each of those individual parts and put them into a "cohesive" experience.
